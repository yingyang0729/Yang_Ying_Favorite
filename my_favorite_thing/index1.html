                <p>
                    I like taking photos because of my father. He likes taking photos. When he was young, he also learned how to draw. However, he gave up drawing because he wanted to be a business man. But he gives the genes for me, I like taking photos and keep this hobby until now.

                <p>
                    I always feel tired. When I was very young, I spent more than two hours on the transportation to my school. After that period, I always feel I need more time to sleep. Now, I live in London but I still want to save more time to sleep. Sleeping is a big element in my life.

                    I am not a open mind person but I still like talking. I have been a educational consulatant for more than three years. I like the job because I can talk with others and help them a lot. In the future, I still want to find a job that I can talk with others. I think I will be a good salesman or I will find a position in a university.
